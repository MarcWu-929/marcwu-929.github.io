    <p>Welcome to my homepage!. I'm an undergraduate senior majoring <b>Geographic Information Science</b> at Capital Normal University (China) and <b>Geography</b> at Northern Illinois University (USA). I'm current working with Dr. Qunying Huang from Spatial Computing and Data Mining lab at University of Wisconsin-Madison to conduct research related to remote sensing and deep learning.</p>

# Education
 **Capital Normal University**

Bachelor of Science in Geographic Information Science, Beijing, China, 2020-Present

**Northern Illinois University**

Bachelor of Science in Geography (GIS Certificate), DeKalb, IL, USA, 2021-2023

# Research Interests
- Remote Sensing and GIS
- Semantic Segmentation
- Machine Learning
- Spatial Analysis
- Forest and Vegetation Mapping
- Natural Hazard

My research lies across the discipline of Geography, Computer Vision and Data Science. My current research focuses on remote sensing image segmentation using deep learning models. Some techniques involved including semantic segmentation, supervised classification, image super sampling, etc. I wish to combine remote sensing technologies with other powerful tools to solve problems related to vegetation and physical geography.
