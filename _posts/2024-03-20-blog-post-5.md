I'm glad that UW-Madison made me an offer for Biological Systems Engineering. Madison has been my dream school for a long time. Although it's not my first-choice majoe, I got the chance of 
maintaining the same research field. After careful consideration, I finally decided to Join UW-Madison and start a new path. Go Badgers!
